A lone ambulance parks itself at the base of the north tower. Somewhere buried in the fog, police cruisers have set up a barricade, though this borders on pure formality in a city with fewer than one in a thousand manual-navigation vehicles. Habituated to long waits during suicide negotiations, two EMTs sit in the cab, staring at opposite ends of a three-level chess board.

Suruchi has just lost a pawn. Forehead tight and lips pursed, she stares at Mark's dark, brooding zombies, looking for a weakness. As she considers drawing out his queen from its perch on the lower level, her fingers hover over a beautifully-rendered, seahorse-like knight at mid-level. The knight breathes sparks and tightens the curve of its tail in anticipation. But just as she reaches to pick it up by the neck, the cab gives a thunderous lurch and her hand sends both dragons and zombies flying.

“Jesus Christ!” Suruchi shouts into the silence that follows, clutching her chest and breathing hard. Mark stares at her, wide-eyed, through the dark lenses of his port. The dense, ice-crystal fog of El Blanco rolls by outside the ambulance windows, glowing mildly under the vehicle's fog lights. Mark relaxes his face and, in typical fashion, hides his feelings behind a joke.

Suruchi just stares at him. He sighs, nodding. With two fingers held out like an airline attendant marking the exits, he makes a sliding motion along the chess board's edge, revealing a simple control panel. He pinches a small tile with an image of a cartoon magnet and the pieces fly back into place.

“To be continued,” he says, squeezing the board between open palms until it's the size of a baseball. He shifts it to the dashboard with a wave, opens the passenger-side door, and steps down to the road. Suruchi takes a deep breath and steps out from behind the override-wheel.

Approaching the ambulance tail lights, Suruchi knows what she will find, and she desperately hopes that she's wrong. Sure enough, the negotiations have failed. There are the limbs, resting at impossible angles. There's the head, light hair darkly drenched around a fist-deep crater at the back of the skull. Eerily, the body is still breathing, though she knows this won't last long.

He nods, but says nothing. He's chewing on his lips. Suruchi has never seen anything like this either, but she's seen enough minds blown from “acute lead poisoning” to know she can handle it. She nods back.

The machine pauses for a machine eternity (roughly the blink of an eye), waiting for potential additions to her request, then, at the speed of light through silicone—through plastic, flesh and air—the pendant beams a simple order to the Portal on her head. A series of gates opens up, freeing millions of pent-up electrons which stampede like invisible bulls through tiny diodes at her temples, knocking loose photons which throws a bright and ghostly glow wherever Suruchi turns her head. It's currently aimed at the rig, next to where Mark had been standing, illuminating a circle in which she now sees something wet dripping off the top-most warning light at the top corner of the box.

Suruchi climbs up onto the bumper and steps sideways until she's half a meter from the point of impact. The roof is dented and…she lets out a long moan. Just above the cracked light, hanging from one of the red-painted rivets, a single silver hair. Dangling from that: a small chunk of scalp.

Bracing herself with a deep breath, Suruchi hops back down to the road, careful to avoid the gleaming spatter-trail of biological shrapnel which, she can now see thanks to her port beams, coats the road in a straight line from the rear fender to the fresh corpse…and beyond. Gizzardy bits glisten like flecks of thick wet paint flung from a swinging paintbrush.

A shiver trickles down Suruchi's throat and down her chest as she fights off her imagination; It's trying to get her to see a fast-spinning body spraying crushed gray matter and bone in a fanning arc. Shaking of a shiver, she turns her attention back to the body. She can hear Mark, muted through the fog, talking to Dispatch in the cab.

The impact seems to have flipped the body aggressively forward, folding the woman against the pavement like a nightmarish rag doll doing yoga: legs spread out in front, but hidden beneath a gossamer sundress; chest nearly to the ground, arms flung forward, one clearly dislocated at the shoulder. Stepping around the victim's feet, Suruchi swallows hard to see that the woman's face and bare heels have been sand-papered by the road.

Suruchi puts her port in recording mode with a wave, and slowly walks around the body, letting the portal generate a photographic 3D model. Standard procedure. When this is done, she swipes a pair of nitrile gloves from a box inside the truck, and switches to audio recording (“<em>Merc. Transcribe.</em>”) and begins to speak words which get translated into text on a virtual page which floats in her riph, where she can glance at it without having it block her view of the calamity below.

Aside from a few drops of blood, there appears to be no external damage to the woman's back, other than the leathery buildup of too many sunburns visible between twin spaghetti straps and along the bare arms. The skin has a loose quality to it, like an old birthday balloon.

“No portal. No sign of pendant straps,” Suruchi says, with a cursory peak at her notes. Then curiosity gets the best of her and she pauses the transcription by twisting her right hand into a closed fist, like a conductor silencing the orchestra.

“Hey, Mark,” she hollers, still crouching, “come give me a hand!” But he's still talking to Control, and she's already lifting from the side, rolling the torso heavily up and off the splayed thighs, looking to see if maybe there's a purse or a wallet hiding under there. The soft flesh at the back of her throat recoils at the close-up stench of evacuated bowels, closing off the passage between her mouth and her olfactory system so that she won't have to taste the full pungency of the breeze-blown air.

There's plenty here to shock even Suruchi's hardened world view, but the first thing to truly grab her attention isn't the face, or what's left of it, nor the horrid mix of body fluids puddled in the dark. Instead, her attention zooms in on a thin triangle protruding the hip. It's unusual to see anyone carrying paper these days, and even more unusual to have a functioning pocket in a diaphanous dress.

Still pushing hard to keep the trunk raised, she slides the paper out. It's a postcard, folded in half, with a photograph of somewhere tropical printed on the outside. Suruchi is vaguely aware that this is not her purview, but there won't be a chance to look at it later. After handing off to the cops or the coroner, she generally never sees- or hears from a body again.

Suruchi shrugs, refolds the card and starts to slide it back into the pocket. It's much harder to get in than it was to get out, and she finds herself, while wriggling it, peeking up at the now-exposed front of the head on these slowly-stiffening remains. She is trying to see the injuries without having to actually <em>look</em>, though, perversely, there's not much to see: everything resembling a face has been shorn off by the final slide across the asphalt.

Mark's voice is so close in her ear that she rears up, startled, clocking him in the chin so hard that his teeth come together with a worrying <em>clack</em>. As Mark stumbles back, face-in-hand, Suruchi finds herself standing beside him, still holding the folded postcard. Without thinking, she stows it in her own pocket while Mark is still yelling, “Fucking hell, Rooch!” into his cupped palms with his eyes shut tight against the pain.

This makes him laugh, which he unwisely attempts to block. The wet tissues at the back of his throat can't fully stop the pressure from his lungs, and so a good amount of it escapes through his nose with a sound like a deflating balloon—and a sudden spray of blood through his fingertips.

Perhaps it's just the natural mimicry of her hapish brain, or perhaps it's the stark contrast between Mark's tiny leak against the geyser emitted by the stranger at their feet: either way, and Suruchi can't stop herself letting escape a sound like a rake being dragged through gravel.

“Sorry,” she says, though in her voice looms a fresh round of laughter. Mark holds his candycane-colored gloves cupped under his slow-dripping nose and pinches his lips to stop himself from joining her.

But he's grinning and shaking from the effort of trying to stay serious. Despite a valiant effort, the muscles of his lips lose easily in the reverse tug-of-war against his diaphragm, and the sudden spray of jet-powered air nebulizes the drop of blood that he’s trying to catch in his hands. Suruchi swears she can feel some of this bonus mist land across her cheek, which she wipes against the back of her hand.

They explode together then. The laughter feels good, as had her apology, which (she does not mention to Mark) was meant not for him, but for whatever ghost might hang here, tangled in the fog. Suruchi forgets about the hitchhiker in her navy blue cargo slacks. Being nothing more, after all, than worn ink and wood pulp, it will come to mind at only the most inopportune of times.

First, there will be the police officers, including a detective, whose arrival will cause the folded image to take up residence in her proprioceptive model; she will feel it in her pocket from memory alone. To distract herself, Suruchi will deliberately dive into the inevitable banter, jumping in with crude in-joke acronyms and a thick façade of nonchalance.

Her guilty panic will rear again when the chief arrives to give her and Mark the rest of the night off. Suruchi will again lose herself in the moment, watching the cops collect flecks of glop from her rig—including that grisly strand of scalp-dangled hair—into sterile containers.

She will absent-mindedly pull the card out in the locker room, back at the station. For a fleeting moment, old pathways in her brain will recognize it as trash; something to be recycled, before the more recent memories kick in. Her shame will retrigger at the sound of a shower turning off. Suruchi will smuggle the contraband with a darting motion into her gym bag, there to be forgotten once more.

Only after she gets home and empties her duffel bag into a laundry basket will Suruchi pause to give the postcard a good look. Only then will it occur to her that she is carrying someone's property. Not the stiff’s, of course. The deceased is now just a pile of doomed meat, incapable of <em>owning</em> anything. But the printed address and the valid postage will argue for a future owner. Someone—someone whose name starts with <em>R?</em>—was supposed to receive this message in the mail. Or were they?

Only when Suruchi has exhausted her quiver of questions will she decide to delay posting the card till morning. But later, as she startle-wakes from her first attempted sink into sleep for the night, it will dawn on her that she has, technically, <em>robbed a corpse</em>. On <em>federal</em> property. <em>And everything’s traceable these days. Cameras on every drop box. It's too soon. The FBI and SFPD are probably giving the case extra scrutiny. After all, it's not every day someone splashes their brains across the 101. And cryptic messages hide cryptic motives. What am I getting snarled up into?</em>

The postcard will rule the roost, for a time, atop a small stack of non-urgent Things To Do, only to be slowly buried by her own keep-sakes, and other half-baked commitments. From there, it will eventually make its way into a box, which itself will maneuver itself into a storage unit. Forgotten.

She pops open a kit and starts patching him as a set of red-white-and-blues pulls loose from the distant row of throbbing emergency lights that make up the barricade.

Behind her, the victim's blood pools and ripples across the asphalt. Following gravity to a crack designed for rain, dark, glistening beads drop silently down, down, down, to be swallowed by the sea.

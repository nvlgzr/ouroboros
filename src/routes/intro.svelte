    alt="An animated introduction to the navelgazer logo, in which a noseless, line-art sort of…bald-headed alien face—seen from the checkbones up—suddenly sprouts a third eye on its ginormous forehead, then, after a bit of looking around, the entire outline of the head flops forward, hinged at the base of those 'cheekbones', flipping to reveal itself as not an alien head, but a wide belly. The 'third eye' is now below the other two eye dots, and what had looked like brow ridges now look like man-boobs with two used-to-be-eye nipples and a used-to-be-third-eye belly button. After a pause, the belly button 'looks' languidly left, then right, then snaps back, almost guiltily, to center."
